3.3. Existing Features summary
Once the start game button is pressed the welcome div will disappear from view and the MIDI file corresponding to the question will begin to play after a few moments. if the user wishes to stop the song they can press the pause button in the question container and they are able to click on an answer and the site will keep the users score until the end of the game.

4. Testing
4.1 Testing via Google Chrome Developer Tools
tested the game on several devices and they all worked well. I could have made the mobile welcome screen better for widths 300 pixels and under but i didn't leave myself enough time to fix it.


4.4. Lighthouse testing
*.html documents were tested via Lighthouse with very good results.
